# 👋 Hi, I’m Danny Kamohelo Ntshala

I’m a **developer with a strong cloud engineering focus**, actively building skills in **Terraform, AWS, and modern web technologies**.  
My goal is clear: **become a qualified Cloud Engineer who can design, automate, and deploy real infrastructure and applications**.

I’m not just learning theory — I focus on **hands-on projects, infrastructure as code, and real-world cloud workflows**.

---

## 🔧 What I’m Currently Working On
- ☁️ **Cloud Engineering (AWS)** – EC2, networking, security, deployments
- 🧱 **Terraform** – infrastructure as code, multi-region setups, automation
- 🐍 **Python** – scripting, automation, backend fundamentals
- 🌐 **HTML, CSS & JavaScript** – web fundamentals for cloud-hosted apps
- 📂 Building portfolio projects that combine **cloud + code**

---

## 🌱 What I’m Actively Learning
- Terraform modules, state, and best practices
- Cloud architecture patterns and cost-aware design
- Web foundations to support full cloud deployments
- Automation mindset (build once, deploy many times)

---

## 🚀 Where I’m Headed
- Become a **professional Cloud Engineer**
- Master **AWS + Terraform** as core tools
- Expand into **DevOps practices** (CI/CD, automation, scalability)
- Grow into a **cloud-focused full-stack engineer**

---

## ⚙️ Background
- 🤖 Mechatronics background
- 🔧 Qualified **Millwright Artisan**
- Strong systems thinking and problem-solving mindset
- Comfortable bridging **hardware, software, and cloud infrastructure**

---

## ⚡ Fun Fact
I come from an engineering trade background — which means I treat cloud infrastructure like real machinery:  
**designed properly, automated, monitored, and built to last.**
